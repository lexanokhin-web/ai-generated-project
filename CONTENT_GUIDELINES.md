# Content Guidelines & Rules for "Ratgeber"

To ensure all articles maintain a high standard of quality, SEO performance, and user engagement, follow these rules for every new piece of content.

## 1. SEO & Long-Tail Keywords
*   **Focus:** Target specific, multi-word queries (long-tail keywords) rather than generic terms.
    *   *Bad:* "Badsanierung"
    *   *Good:* "Kosten für Badsanierung in Ratzeburg 2025" or "Kleines Bad mit Dusche renovieren Ideen"
*   **Placement:** Include the main keyword in the H1 (Title), the first paragraph, and at least one H2.
*   **Structure:** Use proper HTML tags (`<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<ul>`, `<strong>`) to structure the content for search engines.

## 2. "Humanized" Tone & Voice
*   **Be Real:** Write as a human expert, not a robot. Use "We" and "I".
*   **Humor:** It's okay to be lighthearted. Construction can be stressful; a little humor helps.
    *   *Example:* "Dust is our glitter – but we promise to clean it up before we leave."
*   **Empathy:** Acknowledge the customer's pain points (cost, dirt, noise).
*   **Storytelling:** Use mini-anecdotes or examples from real projects.

## 3. Visuals & Formatting
*   **Break it up:** No walls of text. Use short paragraphs (max 3-4 lines).
*   **Visuals:** Every article MUST include placeholders for images, charts, or infographics.
    *   Use `<img src="..." alt="..." class="rounded-xl shadow-md my-6 w-full object-cover" />`
*   **Lists:** Use bullet points and numbered lists frequently.

## 4. Value First
*   **Actionable Advice:** The reader should leave with a clear "next step" or solution.
*   **Local Context:** Mention Ratzeburg, Mölln, Lübeck, and Schleswig-Holstein to boost local SEO.
